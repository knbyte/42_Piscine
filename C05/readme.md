# C05 

C05 is mostly based arouns maths (ew, I know).

## Here are some of the key words and concepts to know:

***Iterative***<br />
Loops through a set of instructions until conditions are met.

***Recursive***<br />
Function calls itself inside its code.

***Factorial***<br />
Product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given positive integer.
*Example: The factorial of 5 is 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 (120).*

***The Multiply and Assignment Operator***<br />
*=   |   Multiplies the operand to the left with the operand to the right and assigns the result to the operand to the left.

***Power (Exponents)***<br />
A number raised to a power represents a product where the same number is used as a repeated factor.
The number is called the base and the power is given by the exponent. The base is the repeated factor (the number multiplied) and the exponent counts the number of factors.
*Example: 53 = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125*
*Example: 82  = 8 × 8 = 64*

***Square Root***<br />
The square root of a target number is the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the target number. 
*Example: The square root of 16 is 4 because 4 x 4 = 16.*

***Prime Number***<br />
Can only be divided by itself and 1 without remainders. The first prime number is 2.

***Fibonacci Sequence***<br />
Adding the last two numbers in a sequence.
*Example: 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8*
*(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8…)*
